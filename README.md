A (partially work in progress) build of a path analysis AI into a tic tac toe game. It utilizes n depth search, sorting move sequence sturtures, probabilistic eval and list sorting to attempt to achieve optimal play.

Not done yet, but has shown promise in testing, with a small memory footprint and efficient processor times.

Thank you, C# garbage collector. Boy have you made me uneasy.
